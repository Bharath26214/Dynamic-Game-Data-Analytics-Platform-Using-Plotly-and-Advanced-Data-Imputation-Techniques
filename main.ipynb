    "<p>The gaming industry has witnessed exponential growth over the years, with digital distribution platforms like <b>Steam</b> playing a pivotal role in reshaping how games are accessed and experienced. Steam, hosting thousands of games spanning diverse genres, provides an immense amount of data that can offer meaningful insights and inferences into the trends, success factors, and categories of games that dominated or will dominate the market.\n",

    "This project aims to delve into the vast datasets of Steam games, exploring their categories, revenue, and review metrics to uncover patterns and trends that define the gaming landscape. By leveraging interactive visualizations and comprehensive data analysis, the project provides actionable insights for game developers, publishers, and gaming enthusiasts alike.</p>"

    "<p>Being gamers, we have always been interested in what makes games successful or well-liked. Playing and exploring various game genres takes up a lot of our time, and we frequently ponder why some games perform so well while others donâ€™t. Because of this, we became curious about the gaming industry and the elements that contribute to its success.\n",
    "There is a lot of information about games on platforms like Steam, including player preferences, earnings, and reviews. However, it can be difficult and challenging to comprehend raw data. We aimed to design something straightforward that would aid the viewing and analysis of this data. We chose to create a dashboard for this project because of this.\n",

    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Dash provides pre-built components for graphs, tables, sliders, dropdowns, and more.</li>\n",
    "<li>Dash applications are reactive. User inputs (e.g., selecting a dropdown or adjusting a slider) dynamically update outputs (e.g., charts, tables).</li>\n",
    "<li>Dash integrates seamlessly with machine learning models, APIs, and databases, making it a good choice for interactive model visualizations and real-time analytics.</li>\n",

    "\n",
    "<h5>Game Reviews</h5>\n",
    "<p>Positive or very positive reviews were given to the majority of the games on Steam. Only a small number of games received negative reviews. Games with more reviews were frequently more profitable, showing a correlation between visibility and success.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>Popular Games and Types</h5>\n",
    "<p>The games with the highest revenue were Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, PUBG, and Dota 2. The most lucrative game genres were co-op, action, and first-person. These genres remained popular over time, consistently generating high revenue.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>Trends Over Time</h5>\n",
    "<p>Some genres, such as trading card games and artificial intelligence, have become more popular in recent years. Meanwhile, older genres like \"Classic\" and \"Masterpiece\" saw a decline in player interest and revenue generation.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>Revenue and Reviews</h5>\n",
    "<p>Games with very positive reviews often had the highest revenue. However, in recent years, there have been examples of highly profitable games that received mixed reviews, showing that other factors also contribute to financial success.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>Game Releases and Revenue Growth</h5>\n",
    "<p>The number of games released annually increased from 50 in 2000 to over 2,000 in 2023. The highest revenue year was 2015, driven by blockbuster titles like Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto V. Revenue increased again in 2020, likely influenced by the pandemic, which led to more people playing games.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>Revenue by Time Period</h5>\n",
    "<p>Revenue grew significantly over time, starting at $283 million from 2000 to 2005 and surpassing $21 billion between 2018 and 2023. Action and co-op games consistently contributed a large portion of the revenue, while other genres gained popularity and market share in later years.</p>\n"

    "\n",
    "<div>Data can be used to better understand the gaming market, as this project demonstrates. The dashboard clearly shows game categories which are popular, the relationship between reviews and earnings, and the evolution of player interests. The most popular game genres over time were discovered to be action, cooperative, and first-person. Recently, new genres like artificial intelligence and trading card games have gained popularity. Additionally, the analysis demonstrates the growth in both revenue and game numbers over time, particularly during pandemic years. When deciding what kinds of games to make and how to increase their chances of success, game developers and marketers can use this dashboard to make better decisions.</div>"
